# account_gen
This can be used to make a bunch of accounts for a vendor, reads in from a csv file
defined 'auto_accout.json'. The Csv file should have 3 header columns labeled as:

lastname firstname email

The columns can be in any order but need to be labeled as shown above. This is
case sensative.
The other account details need to be defined in auto_accout.json then file can be run.

Note this program has been condensed from several files to be a stand alone script.
